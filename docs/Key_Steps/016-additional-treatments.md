### Chapter 6: Additional Treatments in Water Treatment

#### Introduction
In addition to the primary water treatment processes of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, disinfection, and pH adjustment, various additional treatments are employed to address specific water quality issues. This chapter explores these additional treatments, which include processes for removing dissolved gases, heavy metals, organic contaminants, and advanced treatment technologies for emerging pollutants.

#### 6.1 Removal of Dissolved Gases

##### 6.1.1 Aeration
Aeration is used to remove dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from water. By introducing air into the water, these gases are stripped out and vented to the atmosphere. Aeration also increases dissolved oxygen levels, improving water quality.

- **Cascade Aeration:** Water is allowed to flow over a series of steps or cascades, increasing its exposure to air.
- **Diffused Aeration:** Air is diffused through water using fine bubble diffusers, maximizing gas transfer efficiency.
- **Spray Aeration:** Water is sprayed into the air, allowing gases to escape as water droplets come into contact with the atmosphere.

##### 6.1.2 Degasification
Degasification involves removing dissolved gases using vacuum or pressure reduction. This method is particularly effective for removing gases that are difficult to strip with aeration alone.

- **Vacuum Degasification:** Water is subjected to a vacuum, causing dissolved gases to be released.
- **Packed Tower Degasification:** Water flows through a tower packed with media, while a counter-current flow of air strips the gases.

#### 6.2 Removal of Heavy Metals

##### 6.2.1 Chemical Precipitation
Chemical precipitation is used to remove heavy metals by converting them into insoluble compounds that can be filtered out. Common precipitating agents include lime, sodium hydroxide, and sulfide compounds.

- **Hydroxide Precipitation:** Metals are precipitated as metal hydroxides by adjusting the pH to an optimal level.
- **Sulfide Precipitation:** Metals are precipitated as metal sulfides using sulfide compounds, which are highly insoluble.

##### 6.2.2 Ion Exchange
Ion exchange involves exchanging undesirable metal ions in water with more benign ions from an ion exchange resin. This method is effective for removing a wide range of heavy metals and other contaminants.

- **Cation Exchange:** Removes positively charged metal ions (e.g., lead, copper) by exchanging them with hydrogen or sodium ions.
- **Anion Exchange:** Removes negatively charged ions (e.g., chromate) by exchanging them with hydroxide or chloride ions.

##### 6.2.3 Adsorption
Adsorption uses materials like activated carbon, activated alumina, or specialized resins to capture and remove heavy metals from water. Adsorbents have high surface areas and specific affinities for certain metals.

- **Activated Carbon:** Effective for removing organic contaminants and some heavy metals.
- **Specialized Adsorbents:** Tailored for specific metals, such as arsenic or mercury, providing targeted removal.

#### 6.3 Removal of Organic Contaminants

##### 6.3.1 Activated Carbon Adsorption
Activated carbon adsorption is widely used to remove organic contaminants, including pesticides, industrial chemicals, and natural organic matter that can cause taste and odor issues.

- **Granular Activated Carbon (GAC):** Used in large-scale treatment systems, providing extensive contact time for adsorption.
- **Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC):** Added directly to water and subsequently removed by sedimentation or filtration, suitable for short-term or emergency treatment.

##### 6.3.2 Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs)
AOPs involve generating highly reactive species, such as hydroxyl radicals, to oxidize and break down organic contaminants.

- **UV/Hydrogen Peroxide:** UV light activates hydrogen peroxide, forming hydroxyl radicals that degrade contaminants.
- **Ozone/Hydrogen Peroxide:** Ozone reacts with hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals.
- **Photocatalysis:** UV light activates a photocatalyst, such as titanium dioxide, to generate reactive species.

#### 6.4 Advanced Treatment Technologies

##### 6.4.1 Membrane Filtration
Membrane filtration processes, including nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, are used for advanced treatment of dissolved salts, organic compounds, and emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products.

- **Nanofiltration:** Removes multivalent ions and larger organic molecules while allowing monovalent ions to pass through.
- **Reverse Osmosis:** Provides the highest level of filtration, removing nearly all dissolved substances, including salts and small organic molecules.

##### 6.4.2 Biological Treatment
Biological treatment processes utilize microorganisms to degrade organic contaminants and nutrients. These processes are often used in wastewater treatment but are also applicable to drinking water treatment in certain contexts.

- **Biological Activated Carbon (BAC):** Combines activated carbon adsorption with biological degradation, providing dual treatment for organic contaminants.
- **Constructed Wetlands:** Mimic natural wetland processes to treat water through biological, physical, and chemical mechanisms.

##### 6.4.3 Electrodialysis
Electrodialysis uses an electric field to drive ions through selective membranes, separating them from the water. This method is effective for desalination and the removal of specific ions.

- **Electrodialysis Reversal (EDR):** Periodically reverses the polarity of the electric field to prevent fouling and improve efficiency.

#### 6.5 Emerging Contaminants and Innovative Treatments

##### 6.5.1 Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products (PPCPs)
Emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products pose new challenges for water treatment. Advanced oxidation processes, activated carbon, and membrane filtration are among the methods used to address these contaminants.

##### 6.5.2 Microplastics
Microplastics are increasingly recognized as a significant contaminant in water sources. Filtration, including membrane and multimedia filters, is used to remove these tiny particles from water.

##### 6.5.3 Nanotechnology
Nanotechnology introduces innovative materials and methods for water treatment, including nanofiltration membranes, nanoadsorbents, and nano-catalysts that enhance treatment efficiency and target specific contaminants.

#### 6.6 Optimization and Monitoring

##### 6.6.1 Process Integration
Integrating multiple treatment processes can enhance overall treatment efficiency and address a broader range of contaminants. For example, combining coagulation, filtration, and advanced oxidation can provide comprehensive water treatment.

##### 6.6.2 Real-Time Monitoring
Advanced monitoring systems use sensors and automated controls to continuously track water quality parameters and optimize treatment processes. Real-time data allows for immediate adjustments and ensures consistent water quality.

##### 6.6.3 Pilot Testing and Research
Pilot testing and ongoing research are crucial for developing and optimizing new treatment methods. Pilot studies help determine the feasibility and effectiveness of innovative treatments before full-scale implementation.
